Kairos.Stats.Tactic.AnytimeValid — `anytime_valid` tactic.

The marquee tactic that turns `kairos-stats-lean` from a library into a
toolkit. Two variants:

**Countable-time** (no args):

    μ {ω | ∃ t : ℕ, f t ω ≥ c} ≤ (∫ ω, f 0 ω ∂μ).toNNReal / c.toNNReal

given `Supermartingale f 𝓕 μ`, `∀ t ω, 0 ≤ f t ω`, `Integrable (f 0) μ`,
and `0 < c`. Requires `[IsFiniteMeasure μ]`.

**Finite-horizon** (`(horizon := N)`):

    μ {ω | ∃ t : ℕ, t ≤ N ∧ c ≤ f t ω} ≤ ENNReal.ofReal ((∫ ω, f 0 ω ∂μ) / c)

given `Supermartingale f 𝓕 μ`, `∀ t ω, 0 ≤ f t ω`, and `0 < c`.
Requires `[IsProbabilityMeasure μ]`. No `Integrable` hypothesis needed.

Side-conditions discharged via `assumption`.

This is the Phase B (ATH-594) deliverable. Phase A (ATH-593) ships the
underlying theorems; the tactic layer lives here.

## Examples

```
-- Countable-time variant
example {Ω : Type*} {m0 : MeasurableSpace Ω} {μ : Measure Ω}
    [IsFiniteMeasure μ] {f : ℕ → Ω → ℝ} {𝓕 : Filtration ℕ m0}
    (hsup : Supermartingale f 𝓕 μ) (hnn : ∀ t ω, 0 ≤ f t ω)
    (hint : Integrable (f 0) μ) {c : ℝ} (hc : 0 < c) :
    μ {ω : Ω | ∃ t : ℕ, f t ω ≥ c} ≤ (∫ ω, f 0 ω ∂μ).toNNReal / c.toNNReal := by
  anytime_valid

-- Finite-horizon variant
example {Ω : Type*} {m0 : MeasurableSpace Ω} {μ : Measure Ω}
    [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] {f : ℕ → Ω → ℝ} {𝓕 : Filtration ℕ m0}
    (hsup : Supermartingale f 𝓕 μ) (hnn : ∀ t ω, 0 ≤ f t ω)
    {c : ℝ} (hc : 0 < c) (N : ℕ) :
    μ {ω : Ω | ∃ t : ℕ, t ≤ N ∧ c ≤ f t ω} ≤
      ENNReal.ofReal ((∫ ω, f 0 ω ∂μ) / c) := by
  anytime_valid (horizon := N)

/-- Explicit-witness variant: `anytime_valid using h` lets the user supply
the supermartingale term directly instead of relying on `assumption`.

Useful when the hypothesis is named non-standardly, comes from a
lambda-bound term, or is constructed on the fly. Side-conditions
`∀ t ω, 0 ≤ f t ω`, `Integrable (f 0) μ`, and `0 < c` are still
resolved from the local context via `assumption`. -/
