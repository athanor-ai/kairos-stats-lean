Pythia.EDetector — E-detector framework for sequential change detection.

# Overview

An **e-detector** (Shin, Ramdas, Rinaldo 2024) is the sequential-change-detection
counterpart to confidence sequences. Rather than bounding a parameter at every
stopping time, an e-detector maintains a process that is bounded (≤ 1 in
expectation under the null) and grows when a change has occurred, yielding
anytime-valid Type-I error control.

# Core objects

## EProcess
A non-negative process `M : ℕ → Ω → ℝ≥0` with `M 0 = 1` and `E[M τ] ≤ 1`
for every stopping time τ under the null. This is Ville's inequality in reverse:
Ville gives `ℙ(M_τ ≥ c) ≤ 1/c`; the e-process property is `E[M_τ] ≤ 1`.

## EDetector
Given an e-process M and a threshold α ∈ (0, 1), the detector fires at the
first time t where `M t ≥ 1/α`. Anytime-valid Type-I error control:

  ℙ_null(τ_α < ∞) ≤ α.

This follows from Markov's inequality at the stopped value together with
`E[M_{τ_α}] ≤ 1`.

## MartingaleEProcess
A non-negative martingale starting at 1 is automatically an e-process (the
optional-stopping theorem gives `E[M_τ] = E[M_0] = 1` under integrability
conditions; Ville's inequality is the strict supermartingale version).

## ExpEProcess
For an iid sequence X_1, X_2, … that is sub-Gaussian with parameter σ, the
exponential process

  M_t = exp(λ · S_t − t · ψ(λ)),      ψ(λ) = λ² σ² / 2

is a non-negative martingale starting at 1 under the null (sub-Gaussian MGF
equals `exp(ψ(λ))` per step). This bridges the e-detector framework to
`Pythia.SubGaussianMG`.

## Combining e-processes
If M and N are e-processes, so are:
  • `(M + N) / 2` (mixture / averaging) — convexity of the e-class;
  • `M · N` (product) — when M and N are independent.

This enables detector combination (e.g. multi-stream monitoring, independent
sensors aggregated into a single anytime-valid alarm).

# Closure roadmap (per statement)

* `eprocess_supermartingale_bound` — direct application of Ville's inequality
  (`VilleSupermartingale.ville_ineq`) after establishing that any
  supermartingale with E[M_0] = 1 satisfies the e-process bound at stopping times.
  Needs: `OptionalStoppingUnbounded.stoppedValue_le_nnreal` or similar.

* `edetector_type_i_error` — one-line Markov on `M_{τ_α}` + e-process bound.
  Needs: `eprocess_supermartingale_bound` + `MeasureTheory.measure_le_of_integral`.

* `martingale_eprocess_iff` — forward: optional stopping (`stoppedValue_integral_eq`
  for the martingale). Reverse: supermartingale is weaker than martingale, direct.
  Needs: `MeasureTheory.Martingale.stoppedValue_integral_eq`.

* `exp_eprocess_subgaussian` — apply `SubGaussianMG.exp_supermartingale` at the
  optimal λ; M_0 = exp(0) = 1. Uses `HasCondSubgaussianMGF` from Mathlib.

* `combine_eprocesses_avg` — linearity of expectation + convexity.
  Product version needs independence hypothesis.

The `e_bound` field captures `∀ τ bounded stopping time, ∫ M τ ∂μ ≤ 1`.
We carry the bound with respect to bounded stopping times (≤ N for some N)
rather than general stopping times, matching the Doob/Ville machinery
available in Mathlib v4.28.0 for `stoppedValue`. -/

/-! ## Core theorems -/

/-- **E-process supermartingale bound** (Ville-style).

If M is an e-process, then for any threshold `c > 0`:

  ℙ_null(∃ t, M_t ≥ c) ≤ 1 / c.

This is Ville's inequality: the e-process is a non-negative supermartingale
starting at 1, so the measure of the event that M ever exceeds `c` is at
most `E[M_0] / c = 1 / c`.

Closure plan: apply `VilleSupermartingale.ville_ineq` after establishing that
`EProcess.e_bound` implies the supermartingale property on the process. The
key step is the tower property: `E[M_{t+1} | F_t] ≤ M_t` follows from
`e_bound` applied to the constant stopping time t+1 versus t. Then
`ville_ineq` yields the bound directly with `E[M_0] = 1`. -/

/-- **E-detector Type-I error control**.

Given an e-process M and threshold α ∈ (0, 1), define the stopping time:

  τ_α(ω) = inf{t : M_t(ω) ≥ 1/α}

Then `ℙ_null(τ_α < ∞) ≤ α`.

This is the fundamental guarantee of the e-detector framework: by choosing
to alarm at level 1/α, the false-alarm probability under the null is ≤ α
at every stopping time, regardless of how long one observes.

Closure plan: `{ω | τ_α ω < ∞} ⊆ {ω | ∃ t, M.process t ω ≥ 1/α}`. Then
`eprocess_supermartingale_bound` at `c = 1/α` gives the bound as
`ENNReal.ofReal (1 / (1/α)) = ENNReal.ofReal α`. -/

/-- **Non-negative martingales starting at 1 are e-processes**.

A non-negative martingale M with M_0 = 1 satisfies `E[M_τ] ≤ 1` for every
bounded stopping time τ (optional stopping for martingales gives `E[M_τ] = 1`;
for supermartingales the inequality is ≤).

This is the key bridge: every non-negative martingale gives an e-process, and
hence an e-detector. In particular, the Wald SPRT likelihood ratio process
(a positive martingale under H_0) is an e-process.

Closure plan: `MeasureTheory.Martingale.stoppedValue_integral_eq` gives equality
`∫ stoppedValue M τ = ∫ M 0` for a uniformly integrable martingale stopped at a
bounded stopping time. Combine with `M.start_one` and the definition of
`EProcess.e_bound`. The `iff` direction (e-process ⇒ martingale) is false in
general; we state the forward direction only in the `→` and the natural weaker
converse (supermartingale ⇒ e-process) as the `←` arm. -/

/-- **Exponential e-process for sub-Gaussian sequences**.

Let X_1, X_2, … be iid with mean 0 and sub-Gaussian parameter σ under the
null measure μ. For any λ, the exponential process

  M_t(ω) = exp(λ · S_t(ω) − t · λ² σ² / 2),      S_t = Σ_{i < t} X_i

satisfies:
  1. M_0 = 1,
  2. M_t ≥ 0 for all t,
  3. E[M_τ] ≤ 1 for every bounded stopping time τ.

Hence M is an e-process; this bridges `Pythia.SubGaussianMG` to the
e-detector framework. The same process is the building block for
sub-Gaussian anytime-valid confidence sequences.

Closure plan: property (3) follows because `M_t = exp(λ S_t) / exp(t ψ(λ))`
is a non-negative martingale under H_0 (the sub-Gaussian MGF gives conditional
expectation = 1 per step). Apply `martingale_eprocess_iff` to close via the
`SubGaussianMG.exp_supermartingale` construction in `Pythia.SubGaussianMG`.
The `HasCondSubgaussianMGF` hypothesis in `SubGaussianMG` supplies the needed
conditional MGF bound. -/

**Combining e-processes by averaging**.

If M and N are e-processes under the same filtration and null measure μ,
then their average `(M + N) / 2` is also an e-process.

This is the simplest detector-combination result: run two independent
detection methods and average. The e-class is convex, so any mixture of
e-processes is an e-process.

The product `M · N` is also an e-process when M and N are independent, but
that version requires an independence hypothesis and is left as a follow-up.

Closure plan: linearity of the integral gives
  `∫ stoppedValue ((M + N)/2) τ = (∫ stoppedValue M τ + ∫ stoppedValue N τ) / 2`
and by `M.e_bound`, `N.e_bound` both integrals are ≤ 1, so the sum / 2 ≤ 1.
This is a 10-line local proof once the `stoppedValue` linearity lemmas are
identified (likely `stoppedValue_add` + `integral_add` in Mathlib).
